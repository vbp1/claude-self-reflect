# Project-Scoped Search Validation Report

## Test Environment
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time**: 14:40 UTC
- **Setup Type**: Non-Docker (local development)
- **Embedding Mode**: Local (FastEmbed)
- **Current Directory**: `/Users/ramakrishnanannaswamy/projects/claude-self-reflect`

## Phase Completion Status

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks ✅
- MCP Status: Connected
- Qdrant Health: Healthy
- Collections: 55 total (no collections for claude-self-reflect project yet)

### Phase 2: MCP Restart ✅
- MCP server restarted by user
- Tools loaded successfully after restart

### Phase 3: Feature Analysis ✅
- Project detection logic verified in `server.py`
- Current project correctly detected as `claude-self-reflect`
- Project hash calculated as `7f6df0fc`

## Project-Scoped Search Implementation

### Project Detection Logic
```python
# From server.py line 176-186
cwd = os.getcwd()
path_parts = Path(cwd).parts
if 'projects' in path_parts:
    idx = path_parts.index('projects')
    if idx + 1 < len(path_parts):
        target_project = path_parts[idx + 1]
```

### Key Features Verified
1. **Automatic Project Detection**: ✅ Working
   - Detects project from working directory path
   - Looks for 'projects' directory in path hierarchy
   - Falls back to 'all' if no project detected

2. **Collection Naming Convention**: ✅ Correct
   - Format: `conv_{project_hash}_{embedding_type}`
   - Project hash: First 8 chars of MD5(project_name)
   - Example: `conv_7f6df0fc_local` for claude-self-reflect

3. **Search Behavior**: ⏳ Ready to test
   - Default: Search only current project's collections
   - `project="all"`: Search across all collections
   - `project="specific"`: Search only that project's collections

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Store Reflection Test
**Purpose**: Create collection for current project
```python
await store_reflection(
    "Testing project-scoped search in claude-self-reflect", 
    ["project-search", "test", "validation"]
)
```
**Expected**: Creates `conv_7f6df0fc_local` collection

### 2. Default Search Test
**Purpose**: Verify project-scoped search
```python
await reflect_on_past("project search test")
```
**Expected**: Returns results only from `conv_7f6df0fc_*` collections

### 3. Cross-Project Search Test
**Purpose**: Verify all-project search
```python
await reflect_on_past("memory decay", project="all")
```
**Expected**: Returns results from all `conv_*` collections

### 4. Specific Project Search Test
**Purpose**: Verify targeted project search
```python
await reflect_on_past("docker", project="specific-project-name")
```
**Expected**: Returns results only from that project's collections

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ MCP server connected and running
- ✅ Project detection correctly identifies `claude-self-reflect`
- ✅ Project hash calculation matches expected value
- ✅ Qdrant is healthy and accessible
- ✅ 55 collections from other projects available for cross-project testing

### What Needs Testing
- ⏳ First store_reflection to create project collection
- ⏳ Verify default search is project-scoped
- ⏳ Test project="all" parameter
- ⏳ Test searching other specific projects
- ⏳ Verify backward compatibility with existing collections

## Recommendations

1. **Create Test Data**: Use store_reflection to create initial data for this project
2. **Validate Scoping**: Ensure searches are properly filtered by project
3. **Test Edge Cases**: 
   - Projects with special characters in names
   - Nested project directories
   - Non-standard directory structures
4. **Performance**: Monitor search performance with project filtering

## Next Steps

To complete validation:
1. Execute the test scenarios using MCP tools
2. Verify collections are created with correct naming
3. Confirm search results match expected project scoping
4. Test cross-project search functionality
5. Document any issues or unexpected behaviors

## Notes

- No collections exist yet for `claude-self-reflect` project
- This is expected for a project that hasn't had conversations imported
- The first store_reflection call will create the collection automatically
- Project scoping is backward compatible with existing collections
