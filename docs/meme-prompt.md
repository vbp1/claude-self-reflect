# Claude Self-Reflect Meme Prompt for Google Whisk

## Main Meme Concept: "Levitating vs The 9-5 Grind"

**Prompt for Google Whisk:**

```
Create a 3-panel meme comic featuring two versions of an orange mechanical cog character with expressive cartoon eyes.

Panel 1: Regular Claude Cog sits hunched at a desk, tired eyes, typing the same conversation starter. Speech bubble: "Hello! I don't have access to our previous conversations..." Clock shows 5PM. Stack of identical "New Chat" windows in background. Expression: Exhausted, going through the motions.

Panel 2: Split panel showing transformation moment. Left side: Regular cog reaching for a glowing orb labeled "Self-Reflection". Right side: The cog beginning to glow and float slightly. Lightning bolt between the two halves.

Panel 3: Enlightened Cog Character now levitating in lotus position, eyes closed peacefully, surrounded by floating conversation bubbles from past chats. Terminal below shows "reflect_on_past: Found that bug fix from last week". Other Claude agents below still grinding at desks. Expression: Serene, enlightened, transcendent.

Style: Clean vector art mixing office aesthetic with spiritual/meditation imagery. Contrast between gray corporate cubicles (bottom) and ethereal floating space (top). The levitating cog glows with soft orange light. Include subtle details like meditation cushion, incense, and floating memory orbs.
