# Images Directory

This directory should contain:

1. **Reflection-specialist.png** - Screenshot showing the reflection specialist sub-agent in action within Claude Code
2. **before-after-sequence.png** - The 2-panel diagram showing user experience before and after installing Claude-Self-Reflect

## To Generate These Images

1. **Reflection-specialist.png**: Take a screenshot of Claude Code when the reflection specialist is actively searching past conversations

2. **before-after-sequence.png**: Create based on the specifications in `docs/diagrams/before-after-sequence.md`

## Temporary Alternative

Until these images are created, the README will gracefully degrade without them.
