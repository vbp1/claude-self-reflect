# Before-After Sequence Diagram

This diagram should replace the current 4-box architecture diagram with a simple 2-panel sequence showing the user experience.

## Design Specifications

### Style
- Clean, minimal design focusing on the user experience
- Use speech bubbles for dialogue
- Simple iconography (user icon, Claude icon)
- Split screen or two distinct panels

### Panel 1: WITHOUT Claude-Self-Reflect
```
User: "What was that PostgreSQL optimization we figured out last week?"
Claude: "I don't have access to previous conversations. 
         Each conversation starts fresh without memory of past interactions."
User: [Shows frustrated expression, surrounded by multiple chat file icons]
```

### Panel 2: WITH Claude-Self-Reflect  
```
User: "What was that PostgreSQL optimization we figured out last week?"
Claude: [Small search icon appears] "Found it - from our Dec 15th conversation. 
         You discovered that adding a GIN index on the metadata JSONB column 
         reduced query time from 2.3s to 45ms."
User: [Shows satisfied expression, single clean interface]
```

## Key Visual Elements

1. **Time indicator**: Show "Day 1" and "Day 7" to emphasize memory across time
2. **Search visualization**: Subtle animation or icon showing semantic search happening
3. **Emotion**: User frustration in panel 1, satisfaction in panel 2
4. **Clutter vs Clean**: Panel 1 shows many files, Panel 2 shows organized memory

## Alternative Minimalist Version

If going ultra-minimal:

**Before**: Question â†’ "I don't know" â†’ ðŸ˜¤
**After**: Question â†’ [semantic search] â†’ Perfect answer â†’ ðŸ˜Š

## Color Scheme
- Muted grays for "before" panel
- Vibrant blues/greens for "after" panel
- Orange accent for Claude (matching the cog mascot theme)

This visual immediately shows the value proposition without any technical details.
