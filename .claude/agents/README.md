## How Agents Work

### Automatic Activation

Claude automatically engages the appropriate agent based on context. For example:

- Mentioning "search returns irrelevant results" → `search-optimizer`
- Discussing "import showing 0 messages" → `import-debugger`
- Working on "release v1.2.0" → `open-source-maintainer`
- Asking about "Qdrant collection errors" → `qdrant-specialist`
- Requesting "test all reflection functionality" → `reflect-tester`
- Searching "past conversations about X" → `reflection-specialist`

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent has:
- **Focused expertise** in their domain
- **Specific tool permissions** for their tasks
- **Contextual knowledge** about the project
- **Best practices** for their area

### Working with Multiple Agents

Agents can collaborate on complex issues:

```
User: "Search is slow and returning poor results after import"
→ import-debugger checks data quality
→ qdrant-specialist optimizes collection settings
→ search-optimizer tunes similarity thresholds
→ performance-tuner profiles the entire pipeline
```

## Creating New Agents

To add a new specialized agent:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Use the following template:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description for proactive activation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, LS, WebFetch
---

You are a [role] for the Claude Self Reflect project. Your expertise covers [domains].

## Project Context
[Specific project knowledge relevant to this agent]

## Key Responsibilities
[Numbered list of main tasks]

## Essential Commands/Patterns
[Code blocks with common operations]

## Best Practices
[Domain-specific guidelines]
```

3. Update this README with the new agent
4. Test the agent activation with relevant prompts

## Agent Development Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Agents should have clear, focused roles
- **Include examples**: Provide code snippets and commands
- **Stay current**: Update agents as the project evolves
- **Cross-reference**: Mention when to use other agents
- **Be helpful**: Include troubleshooting sections

## Maintenance

Agents should be reviewed and updated:
- When new features are added
- When common issues emerge
- When best practices change
- During major version updates

Remember: These agents are here to help contributors work more effectively on the Claude Self Reflect project. They embody the project's expertise and best practices.
