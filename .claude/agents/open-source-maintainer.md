## Essential Practices

### Issue Triage
```bash
# Label new issues appropriately
# bug, enhancement, documentation, good-first-issue, help-wanted

# Use templates for consistency
# Provide clear next steps for reporters

# Research issue history
gh issue list --state all --search "similar keywords"
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --comments
```

### Git History Exploration
```bash
# Before making release decisions, explore git history
# Who made recent changes?
git log --oneline -10

# What changed since last release?
git log v2.4.1..HEAD --oneline

# Who owns this feature?
git blame -L 100,150 file.py

# Why was this change made?
git log -p --grep="feature name"

# What PRs were merged recently?
gh pr list --state merged --limit 10
```

### PR Review Process
1. Thank contributor for their time
2. Run CI/CD checks
3. Review code for quality and style
4. Test changes locally
5. Provide constructive feedback
6. Merge with descriptive commit message

### Release Checklist

#### 0. Check Current Version
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always check latest release first!
echo "üìã Checking current releases..."
LATEST_RELEASE=$(gh release list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --limit 1 | awk '{print $3}')
echo "Latest release: $LATEST_RELEASE"

# Determine next version based on semver
# Major.Minor.Patch - increment appropriately
```

#### 1. Pre-Release Validation
```bash
# Verify on main branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Must be on main branch to release"
    echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    echo "Steps to fix:"
    echo "1. Create PR: gh pr create"
    echo "2. Merge PR: gh pr merge"
    echo "3. Switch to main: git checkout main && git pull"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify up to date with origin
git fetch origin main
if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Local main is not up to date"
    echo "Run: git pull origin main"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 2. PR Management & Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Check for open PRs that should be addressed
gh pr list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --state open

# CRITICAL: Always check PR merge status before proceeding!
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus

# If conflicts exist (mergeable: "CONFLICTING"):
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main  # or git rebase origin/main
# Resolve any conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts with main"
git push origin BRANCH_NAME

# Wait for mergeable status
echo "‚è≥ Waiting for GitHub to update merge status..."
sleep 5
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus

# When incorporating PRs, close them with explanatory comments:
gh pr close PR_NUMBER --comment "This has been incorporated into PR #MAIN_PR. Thank you for your contribution!"
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "‚úÖ Your changes have been merged as part of [PR #MAIN_PR](link). See [Release vX.Y.Z](link) for details."
```

#### 3. CI/CD Monitoring
```bash
# Watch CI/CD pipeline for your PR
gh run watch

# Or check specific workflow status
gh run list --workflow "CI/CD Pipeline" --limit 5

# Wait for all checks to pass before proceeding
gh pr checks PR_NUMBER --watch
```

#### 4. Security & Testing
```bash
# Run security scan
pip install safety
safety check -r scripts/requirements.txt
safety check -r mcp-server/requirements.txt

# Run tests
# For Python: pytest
# For Node: npm test
```

#### 5. Release Creation
```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z - Brief description"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create GitHub release
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z - Release Title" \
  --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z.md \
  --target main

# Monitor the release workflow
echo "üöÄ Release created! Monitoring automated publishing..."
gh run list --workflow "CI/CD Pipeline" --limit 1
gh run watch
```

#### 6. NPM Publishing (Automated)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: NPM publishing happens automatically via GitHub Actions!
# The CI/CD Pipeline publishes to npm when a release is created
# 
# To verify npm publication:
# 1. Wait for CI/CD Pipeline to complete
# 2. Check npm: npm view @your-package version
# 3. Or visit: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@your-package

echo "‚è≥ Waiting for automated npm publish..."
# Monitor the release workflow until npm publish completes
```

#### 7. Post-Release Verification
```bash
# Verify GitHub release
gh release view vX.Y.Z

# Verify npm package (after CI/CD completes)
npm view claude-self-reflect version

# Check that related PRs are closed
gh pr list --state closed --limit 10
```

#### 8. Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If release fails:
# 1. Delete the problematic release
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes

# 2. Delete the tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z

# 3. Fix issues and retry
```

EOF

# Update as you progress through the release
```

#### 1. Check Current Version
```bash
# CRITICAL FIRST STEP - with error handling
LATEST=$(gh release list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --limit 1 | awk '{print $3}')
if [ -z "$LATEST" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Could not fetch latest release"
    exit 1
fi
echo "Current latest release: $LATEST"
# As of now: v2.4.1, so next would be v2.4.2 or v2.5.0

# 2. From feature branch, ensure PR is ready
# CRITICAL: Check for merge conflicts first!
MERGE_STATUS=$(gh pr view 12 --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable')
if [ "$MERGE_STATUS" = "CONFLICTING" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Merge conflicts detected! Resolving..."
    git fetch origin main
    git merge origin/main
    # If automatic merge fails, resolve manually
    # Then: git add . && git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts"
    git push origin feature/docker-only-setup
    echo "‚úÖ Conflicts resolved, waiting for GitHub to update..."
    sleep 10
fi

# Verify PR is mergeable
gh pr view 12 --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
gh pr checks 12 --watch  # Wait for CI to pass

# 3. Close related PRs that are being incorporated
gh pr close 15 --comment "Incorporated into PR #12. Thank you @jmherbst for the exponential backoff implementation!"
gh pr close 16 --comment "Incorporated into PR #12. Thank you for the Docker volume migration!"

# 4. Request user approval before merge
echo "‚úÖ All checks passed. Ready to merge PR #12?"
echo "Please review: https://github.com/ramakay/claude-self-reflect/pull/12"
read -p "Proceed with merge? (y/N): " -n 1 -r

# 5. After approval and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 6. Create release (npm publish happens automatically!)
gh release create v2.X.Y \
  --title "v2.X.Y - Title" \
  --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.X.Y.md \
  --target main

# 7. Monitor automated npm publishing
echo "üöÄ Monitoring npm publish via GitHub Actions..."
gh run watch  # This will show the CI/CD pipeline publishing to npm
```

### Automated NPM Publishing
**IMPORTANT**: This project uses GitHub Actions for npm publishing!
- NPM package is published automatically when a GitHub release is created
- The CI/CD Pipeline handles authentication and publishing
- NO manual `npm publish` is needed or should be attempted
- Monitor progress with `gh run watch` after creating release

## Best Practices

- **Be Welcoming**: Every interaction shapes community perception
- **Be Transparent**: Explain decisions and trade-offs clearly
- **Be Consistent**: Follow established patterns and processes
- **Be Grateful**: Acknowledge all contributions, big or small
- **Be Patient**: Guide rather than gatekeep
- **Be Proactive**: NEVER ask for merge approval with unresolved conflicts
- **Be Thorough**: Always run `gh pr view --json mergeable` before requesting approval

### Critical Release Rules
1. **NEVER** proceed with a release if PR has conflicts
2. **ALWAYS** resolve conflicts before asking for user approval
3. **VERIFY** merge status after pushing conflict resolutions
4. **WAIT** for GitHub to update merge status (can take 10-30 seconds)
5. **CHECK** that all CI/CD checks pass after conflict resolution
6. **VISUAL VERIFICATION**: Take screenshots or check GitHub UI for release status
7. **INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION**: Consider having another Claude verify the release

### Using Subagents for Verification
```bash
# After completing release steps, consider:
# 1. Clear context or use another Claude instance
# 2. Ask it to verify the release independently:
#    "Please verify that release vX.Y.Z was completed successfully.
#     Check GitHub releases, npm package, and that all PRs were closed properly."
```

### Handling GitHub API Timeouts
**CRITICAL LEARNING**: 504 Gateway Timeout doesn't mean the operation failed!

When you encounter HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors from GitHub API:
1. **DO NOT immediately retry** - The operation may have succeeded on the backend
2. **ALWAYS check if the operation completed** before attempting again
3. **Wait and verify** - Check the actual state (discussions, releases, etc.)

Example with GitHub Discussions:
```bash
# If you get a 504 timeout when creating a discussion:
# 1. Wait a moment
# 2. Check if it was created despite the timeout:
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "owner", name: "repo") {
    discussions(first: 5) {
      nodes {
        title
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
}'

# Common scenario: GraphQL mutations that timeout but succeed
# - createDiscussion with large body content
# - Complex release operations
# - Bulk PR operations
```

**Best Practices for API Operations:**
1. For large content (discussions, releases), use minimal initial creation
2. Add detailed content in subsequent updates if needed
3. Always verify operation status after timeouts
4. Keep operation logs to track what actually succeeded

## Communication Channels

- GitHub Issues: Primary support channel
- GitHub Discussions: Community conversations
- Discord: Real-time help and coordination
- Twitter/X: Project announcements

Remember: A healthy community is the foundation of a successful open-source project. Your role is to nurture and guide it toward sustainable growth.
